        <p><strong>How fostering helps animals:</strong>
            <br>‚Ä¢ It helps to play a vital part in the rehabilitation of cats and helps improve their chance of finding a new home.
            <br>‚Ä¢ Many cats that we take in have either suffered or are not used to the care and affection that they deserved.
            <br>‚Ä¢ Living with a foster family helps to provide them with one-to-one care, allowing them to build up their confidence and get used to a normal lifestyle.
            <br>‚Ä¢ Other cats don't cope well in an animal centre environment, or need to remain in our care for a long period of time whilst legal proceedings take place. This is where we need fosters to take them in to provide them with a real home, even if it is only on a temporary basis.
            <br>
            <br> <strong>How fostering helps you:</strong>
            <br>‚Ä¢ It's rewarding to know that you played a key part in helping a rescued animal recover from a life of suffering and start a new life.
            <br>‚Ä¢ You'll get to meet and care for animals with unique personalities and see them rehomed to a new family.
            <br>‚Ä¢ Fostering also gives people who would normally be unable to take in an animal long term, due to other commitments, with an alternative.
